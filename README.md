As a passionate data scientist I took up this project to see the most common words used by data scientist on Twitter and their sentiment toward their learning and carreer. In this project, I scrapped data from twitter which represent users sentiment towards Elon Musk purchase of twitter.

I created a function with regex application to clean tweet with #, @, rt: etc and replace them with ''

This project was intersting and chanllenging as i learnered alot in the process.
